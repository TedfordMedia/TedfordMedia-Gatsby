Welcome to TedfordMedia, your one-stop destination for all things 3D. I'm Ted (Andrew Tedford), and I've created this portfolio and blog site to showcase my work in various 3D technologies, including Three.js, A-Frame, 8th Wall, Unity, and Unreal Engine. You'll find demos and samples of my projects in WebGL, augmented and virtual reality, as well as my thoughts and insights on the latest trends in the field. This site is built using React, Gatsby, Three.js, and React-Three/Fiber, so you can expect a smooth and immersive experience as you explore my work. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy what you see!
