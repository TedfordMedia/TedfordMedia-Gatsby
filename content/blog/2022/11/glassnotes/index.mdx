<Layout>
  Here's a basic Revit model converted to GLB and rendered in React-Three-Fiber.
  The glass is a PBR material which is more realistic than the standard glass
  material.
  <br />
  <br />
</Layout>

<div style="width: 100%; height: 60vh; position: relative; overflow: hidden;">
  <MainFloorDemo />
</div>

Here is the relevant material. In addition to this, an environment map is used to give the glass good reflection.

<code>
    let glassMaterialExterior = new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
      metalness: 0.11,
      roughness: 0,
      clearcoat: 1,
      transmission: 1,
      specularIntensity: 1,
      envMap: envMap,  
      sheen: 1,
      clearcoatRoughness: 0,
      color: "#ffffff",
      reflectivity: 0.9,
      ior: 1,
      thickness: 0.5, 
    });
</code>
