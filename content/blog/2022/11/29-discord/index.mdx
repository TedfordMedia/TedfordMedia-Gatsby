  The concept here is to be able to talk to a Discord Bot that deciphers commands and triggers updates to a Three.js demo scene.
 Markup : * Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2

-OR-

 Markup : - Bullet list
              - Nested bullet
                  - Sub-nested bullet etc
          - Bullet list item 2

Here is the relevant material. In addition to this, an environment map is used to give the glass good reflection.

```
    let glassMaterialExterior = new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
      metalness: 0.11,
      roughness: 0,
      clearcoat: 1,
      transmission: 1,
      specularIntensity: 1,
      envMap: envMap,
      sheen: 1,
      clearcoatRoughness: 0,
      color: "#ffffff",
      reflectivity: 0.9,
      ior: 1,
      thickness: 0.5,
    });
```
</Layout>
